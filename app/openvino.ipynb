      "Helpful Answer: The extension of the probation period is a legal process that allows a person to extend the probationary period of their sentence beyond the original length of their sentence. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as if the person is not able to comply with the terms of their probation or if they have a change of circumstances that make it necessary to extend their probation. The length of the extension can vary depending on the circumstances, but it is typically limited to a maximum of two years.\n"

      "Staff referal incentive policy is one of the main policies implemented by the company to encourage staff to refer their friends to the company. This policy allows employees to refer their friends to the company and get a percentage of the referral fee as a reward.

The company has a dedicated team of recruiters who are responsible for reviewing and approving the referrals made by the employees. The company also provides a support system to the employees who refer their friends to the company, such as training and resources to help them succeed. The company also has a transparent policy that allows employees to see the referrals made by their colleagues and the amount of referral fee earned by them. This policy helps in building trust and loyalty among employees and encourages them to refer their friends to the company.\n"

      "Answer: The leave policy is designed to provide flexibility for employees to take time off when they need it. The policy allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year, with a maximum of 52 weeks in any 12-month period. This includes parental leave, sick leave, and compassionate leave. The policy also provides for a number of other benefits, such as bereavement leave, family leave, and parental bonding leave. Employees are expected to use their leave in a responsible manner and to return to work as soon as possible. If an employee is unable to return to work, they may be eligible for a short-term disability insurance plan.\n"
